                            <p> Most people know the story of Captain ‚ÄúSully‚Äù Sullenberger, who ditched US Airways flight 1549 in the middle of New York‚Äôs Hudson River after birds destroyed both engines, saving the lives of everyone on board. Also well-known is the story of flight attendant Vesna Vulovic, who survived a mid-air bombing at 33,000 feet and went on to become a Serbian folk hero. These are remarkable tales of survival against the odds that stick with us through the decades‚Äîthose moments when everyone lived Here are my personal Current Top 10 Unlikely Horror Heroes and/or Final Survivors (by date amp alphabetically): üëç (Note: Regarding recurring characters, I'm only listing them in context of the films they're introduced in) amp#x200B; 1) Laurie Strode (Halloween, 1978) 2) Ellen Ripley ( Alien , 1979) 3) Ashley "Ash" Williams ( The Evil Dead , 1981) 4) Nancy Thompson ( A Nightmare on Elm Street , 1984) 5) Charley Brewster ( Fright Night , 1985) Nearly every horror film has a certain of type character whom survives the events of the film - often the cute, unassuming, most responsible, and intelligent (but never the overt bimbo, sexy, popular; whom tend to have the worst deaths) . Typically the girl next door persona who escapes with her life while all the other characters die. Very occasionally, her boyfriend (also the Boy Next Door or even action type) survives.

Now for narrowly the past decade we have been in a massive slasher movie drought that seemed to have had no potential end in sight until the release of Halloween only a few months ago. Now with that their comes the promise of a potential new dawn with horror movies in terms of the slasher genre potential revival. How do I play into all you may ask? Well, prior to the film coming out, I have been working on a long standing project. 
In space, no one will hear you mumble about how bad it is: #It Came from Outer Space I'm not saying it's aliens. but it's aliens. Three films of man against those from other worlds. First, Ash and Chekov discover the threat from alien cyborgs. on the moon! Next, Tobe Hooper remakes his childhood favorite '50s horror in this Cannon flick. Finally, WWII's biggest battle wasn't against the Nazis, but from the survivors of an alien spaceship's wreckage! I suspect "wreck" SURVIVOR Results: This was a roller coaster of a round, with a few different styles taking the top spot for awhile. In the end, with 14 votes, 2006's style has been eliminated. It led second place by 4 votes, which had 9. Everything else was in descending order from there. Summary: In his final movie role, we saw David play the internet's favorite inventor, Nicola Tesla, in Christopher Nolan's film The Prestige. This is the only style on the list where, rather than doing. Who are Yellow Magic Orchestra? Yellow Magic Orchestra were a Japanese synthpop band formed in 1978 by three musicians who already had pretty successful careers as songwriters, producers and musicians. By blending their love of Kraftwerk synthpop with joyously catchy melodies, quirky Moroder disco beats, vocoded vocals and, later on, samplers and J-pop, they ended up creating a sound that culled from dozens of influences but was still wholly unique. Their sound was massively influential. Edit : The years 1950-1975 have been added, bringing the total to 201. I decided to divide these up according to year: 1950 : No Way Out (https://youtu.be/eEsRfQd9lbw) - A black doctor is assigned to treat two racist white, robbery suspects who are brothers, and when one dies, it causes tension that could start a race riot. Stage Fright (https://youtu.be/iNVlqWL4UnA) - A struggling actress tries to help a friend prove his innocence when he's accused of murdering the husband. Few horror villains are more iconic, or more frightening, than the movie slasher. Dating back to the penny dreadfuls of old London Town, human beings have made up some of our most frightening and pervasive villains. While books rarely explore slashers, thanks to the rise of the slasher in the 80s we have more than enough movies to fill out this list several times over, so let‚Äôs get to it! The Good: Psycho (1960): One of the first, and also one of the best. Psycho comes I decided to divide these up according to year: 1950 : No Way Out (https://youtu.be/eEsRfQd9lbw) - A black doctor is assigned to treat two racist white, robbery suspects who are brothers, and when one dies, it causes tension that could start a race riot. Stage Fright (https://youtu.be/iNVlqWL4UnA) - A struggling actress tries to help a friend prove his innocence when he's accused of murdering the husband of a high society entertainer. The Men (https://youtu.be/346Kp86N4a4) "You can't tame what's meant to be wild, doc. It just ain't natural." -Erle Kenton The Howling follows a Los Angeles news anchor, Karen White (Dee Wallace), who narrowly manages to survive an incident with a serial killer. Suffering from PTSD and amnesia, Karen's therapist sends her and her husband Bill Neill (Christopher Stone) to a secluded resort in the countryside called The Colony, but what they don't know is that the residents of The Colony are actually werewolves, and they're looking. 
After nominations, we have a list of almost 70 films. That list needs to be pared down, of course, so we're having this knockout round. Films that share a name with other films, whether remakes or not, are listed with the year on the form. If you're still not sure which version is being considered, each film title below is a link to its Letterboxd page. If I wasn't reasonably sure which film was being nominated from a title, I included both films. I think that's about it, so let's Stories From Straight, Inc.
