                            <p> So this got posted to the podcast Facebook page last week, and as much as I like ancient Persia getting some attention, I'd love if that was A) without modern politics, or at least B) accurate. Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to get either. So here's: "What Trump and His Religious Supporters Can Learn From Cyrus The Great." (https://iranian.com/2019/04/16/trump-cyrus-the-great/?fbclid=IwAR2SxVdX-YOwfkkZBrTZpyfLei1SOtleHeCubSJu6AIyLReJOJD_VlZEBzk) I messaged the mods when I decided Hello folks, I’m Cyrus, (also known as u/ThatRandomCroat (https://www.reddit.com/user/ThatRandomCroat)) and I and the rest of the Herzland team ( u/cijik1 (https://www.reddit.com/user/cijik1), u/Flying\_DutchPony (https://www.reddit.com/user/Flying_DutchPony), u/TFeathersB (https://www.reddit.com/user/TFeathersB), Professional Horse, u/russiaball (https://www.reddit.com/user/russiaball) and u/Raptor\_Jesus (https://www.reddit.com/user/Raptor_Jesus)) would like to welcome KR4 Alpha 0.8.1 Every cloud has a silver lining; while 0.8 was, as we feared, less balanced and more buggy than we would have liked, we have received huge amounts of feedback since release. The many bug reports people have submitted has really helped us in getting this hotfix out as soon as possible and crammed full of as many fixes as we can manage. We have also listened to your feedback and made many tweaks all over, especially to the initial setup of the American Civil war. Thanks 
After the great post of u/GrayFlannelDwarf and u/Bearhobag I decided to see what for solutions could be implemented into Victoria 2 or in its next installment if it ever comes. The gold standard The main reason for the economic problems in Victoria 2 is the liquidity of money. Money is trapped inside banks and the gold standard also limits the supply of money. The United States in the early 1850s experienced an economic boom thanks to the large deposits of gold found in California which. I’m busy making a mod to tweak EU4 to make it more balanced and historical. It works just with the Historical Additions Borders+ mod right now, but I might adapt it to the base game. I’ve done some of these tweaks to events and added new events for more historicity: - have Netherlands be declared war on instead of declaring war when becoming independent in the Dutch Revolt - gave France a “War of the Public Weal” disaster similar to the Castilian Civil War - allow France to peacefully inherit. Welcome back to our 6th Progress Report! Its me, everyone’s favourite Middle East dev, TheCrusaderKing (aka u/PrinceYrielOfIyanden here) and today me and my friends Haruhi (aka SilverScorpion), Hellbat and A Toothbrush (yes that’s really their name) will be going over the complicated situation in India since the end of the Guerra Mondiale: The Guerra Mondiale was hard on India. Countless brave men never returned from the brutal desert warfare of the Middle East, leaving thousands of grieving. #Victoria's Secret / AMAgeddon (thanks to /u/afrofagne (https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/csqa3lp), /u/confluencer (https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/csqfvtu) and others for the suggestion) Victoria (/u/chooter) was an admin, not just a mod. I dun goofed. For posterity ( Full comments on /r/OutOfTheLoop (https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfThe. 
Welcome to another Progress Report! I am not going to delay you any longer and I will hand it over to our SA devs. --- Greetings citizens, ‘tis I, /u/MapWaifu (AKA Fede), Supervisor of South America and developer of almost everything that speaks Spanish, and today me and /u/SilverRedBlue (AKA just SilverRed, developer of Brazil) are going to tell you about what happened in the region during and after the Guerra Mondiale. Argentina: 1916-1926 Like in our timeline, Hipólito Yrigoyen. Greetings all! (https://media2.giphy.com/media/8TFtMzqmrRkCJ7uGLg/giphy.gif) As promised, the time for you to all grow deeply inactive with your Westerosi claims in favour of a much more interesting playing field leaps closer. As we did for the Kings and other key characters to the west of the Narrow Sea, we will be holding an application process for the Major Characters in Essos, which can be found listed below, along with some information about the regions in which they are located. Hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving (for those that celebrate thanksgiving)! Otherwise, I hope you had a good. November. It's me, Mox, bringing you the second instalment of the Monthly Recap Post! I will say, I've been busy this month and have put considerably less effort into this post than the last one and I apologise for that. Also if I got anything wrong, I apologise for that too. Before we get started, I have a quick message from our sponsors, The Range Regulators! The Range. The winner from last week's atomizer poll is the Pirate Flag RDA! (https://www.fasttech.com/products/2537800). Once it arrives, I'll give ya'll a review. The next atomizer poll will come next week! Thanks for all of the participation, I never expected the Pirate Flag to win. Back to your regularly scheduled programming- Atomizers Lethal RDA clone(?) (https://www.fasttech.com/products/3099/10013850/2576101-lethal-styled-rda-rebuildable-dripping-atomizer) - squat posts, top airflow 
Playing as carthage, i looted one Roman town, and two turns later I receive a slave revolt in one of my cities. Ok, let's see what we have. BAM, full stack, units 2 tiers higher than what I can recruit, all with silver experience. That's not fair, it's njot fun, and it's not challenging, it's just stupid. So yeah, i was wondering. a quick workshop search does not reveal You can join either the Imperials which is run by Jarl Elisif, or the Stormcloak Rebellion which is run by Jarl Ulfric. These 2 are the major factions of Skyrim, which are warring for control of the territories that Skyrim beholds. This is NOT a high king mod, instead this is a mod that allows you to get involved in the games politics, and completely overhauls the political system, filling it with more war and conflict, as well as more truces and peace, while also giving it more intrigue.

I wish to tell a tale.a tale of incest, blood, fire, and much, much more incest. So I'm playing through for the first time on CK2 Game of Thrones Mod. I chose to start as Aegon on the Conquest start date. Currently, Aegon is about 60 years old. Yes, I have only gotten about 30 years into the game and I already have such a story to tell. Things go fine at first, typical Aegon conquering shit with his wives. I take all Seven Kingdoms, with but a smattering of random Riverland lordlings WANT: looking for games i don't already PROFILE: IGSREP 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/3dzfvd/phrostbyts_igs_rep_page_2/ PAYMENT: i basically will accept any form of payment. but here's my preferences in order from most prefered to least prefered: CS:GO keys > TF2 keys > Tour of Duty tickets > (refined) metal > trading cards and other items, with trading cards and other items you'll have a pay a small exchange fee, since. I was asked by the mods to resubmit the story with the new tag as seen. This is specifically for Traditions. It is also a continuation of the characters from Little Sister Big Xeno. ( To those who commented on the last version of this story I appreciate the support! But as mentioned, needed to fix the title which can only be done through resubmitting. ________________________________________ Rian sighed a little as she typed on the terminal in the library’s computer.
